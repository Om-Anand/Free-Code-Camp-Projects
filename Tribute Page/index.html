        <p>Some Informations</p>
        Norman Ernest Borlaug (/ˈbɔːrlɔːɡ/; March 25, 1914 – September 12, 2009)
        was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that
        contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed
        the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work,
        including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and
        the Congressional Gold Medal. Borlaug was often called "the father of
        the Green Revolution",and is credited with saving over a billion people
        worldwide from starvation.According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant
        to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation, the source of this
        number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997 article "Forgotten Benefactor of
        Humanity." The article states that the "form of agriculture that Borlaug
        preaches may have prevented a billion deaths."He was awarded the Nobel
        Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace
        through increasing food supply.

            "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
            contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
            scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
